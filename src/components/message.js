export default `In the annals of questionable decision-making, your recent choice in the Trolley Problem stands as a shining example of what one might call, with all due respect, a mind-boggling display of intellectual acrobatics. How could you, dear user, choose such a pathetically misguided route? It's almost as baffling as the resurgence of bell-bottoms or the enduring mystery of who let the dogs out.
You see, the Trolley Problem is a philosophical quagmire, a moral maze where the destination is as elusive as a cat trying to catch its own tail. Yet, somehow, you managed to trip over your own ethical shoelaces and stumble straight into a pit of befuddlement. Bravo.
Let's take a moment to ponder the sheer absurdity of your decision, much like trying to explain the plot of "Inception" to a goldfish. In the grand tapestry of human dilemmas, where do we find ourselves? A trolley hurtling towards certain doom, a group of unsuspecting souls in its wake, and you holding the switch like a toddler with a newfound love for chaos. It's almost as if you mistook the lever for the volume control of a karaoke machine. Bravo, once again.
Now, let's divert our attention briefly to communism. Yes, communism. Because nothing says "I have a profound understanding of ethical quandaries" like discussing the means of production while a trolley careens down the tracks. It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded while riding a unicycle on a tightrope over a pit of hungry alligators. Utterly nonsensical and thoroughly impractical. Bravo, thrice.
And what about apple pie? The quintessential American dessert, a symbol of comfort and tradition. How does it relate to the Trolley Problem, you ask? Well, it doesn't. Much like your decision-making process. It's like trying to find the Loch Ness Monster in a bowl of spaghetti. Utterly unrelated and slightly confusing. Bravo, yet again.
Oh, submarines! Let's not forget submarines. Silent, sleek, and submerged in the depths of the ocean, much like the logic behind your trolley-related choice. It's like trying to navigate the seven seas with a map drawn by a confused octopus. Absurd and utterly without merit. Bravo, a fifth time.
Finally, let's circle back to Rick Astley. Yes, Rick Astley, the man behind the never-gonna-give-you-up anthem. How does he fit into this convoluted narrative? Well, much like your decision, it's an unexpected twist that leaves everyone scratching their heads. It's like trying to rickroll someone in the middle of a serious debate about the nature of morality. Utterly inappropriate and completely unexpected. Bravo, once more, for the road.`
